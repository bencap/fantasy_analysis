# fantasy_analysis

Using the Sleeper API to analyze our leagues' results. You can view an interactive version of these notebooks on the web on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bencap/fantasy_analysis/HEAD). Simply add the repository information after following the link and launch the server. Most weeks I dive into a specific aspect of the week and try to analyze our fantasy league in a way that is deeper than the summary statistics provided on the league homepage.

To run these notebooks on your personal machine, first clone the repository into a directory of your choice. Then run 
```
pip install requierements.txt
```
to install the required dependencies. After these are installed, run
```
jupyter notebook
```
to initialize the local notebook server and run/view the files.
