Using the Sleeper API to analyze our leagues' results. You can open and run these interactive notebooks on Binder[https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/bencap-fantasy_analysis-lr5m89ea/lab/workspaces/auto-5/tree/week8_analysus.ipynb]. These notebooks
dive into league point scoring and create new statistics and analyses to better understand fantasy performance by team.

To any prospective employers, please excuse any typos or lewd language from my fantasy leaguemates!
