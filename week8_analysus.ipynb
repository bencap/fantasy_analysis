    "For the week 8 deep dive, I will be creating and digging into a stat that Tom inspired me to try as a joke. Tom asked to do a wins above replacement stat (WAR) for Aiyuk, who obviously has not been the best fantasy performer this year.  Diligent readers probably noticed I wrote 'Aiyuk is ASS' as his WAR value. Regardless, I wanted to do something similar for this week since it will be pretty interesting to see the degree to which a player impacts a team. In fantasy, some position groups are simply more important because the dropoffs in player output is so much more drastic (This is why we generally draft RBs before WRs before QBs!). Since we have less games to sample from, I will try to analyze points above replacement (PAR) for players on a roster. Hopefully this will give some insight into the top performers on a roster and their overall contributions to a players' team. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Applying Rigor to PAR (and PAA)\n",
    "#### This section dives more deeply into the logic behind my calculations and motivation for creating two classes of statistic. I would recommend reading it, but if that doesn't interest you as much you can skip it\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of WAR as stated on the Baseball-Reference website is “A single number that presents the number of wins the player added to the team above what a replacement player . . . would add.” For their purposes, a replacement player is defined as a player taken from the top minor league level. Of course, we don't have this selection luxury in fantasy which begs the question of what our replacement calculation should use. There is also debate in the baseball community, which I think informs our decision making process. Just due to the nature of rosters and player ownership, an average player may actually be difficult to acquire and require a team to trade value in pursuing their acquisition. With that said, it is clear that a true 'replacement' level player is one that is able to be picked up just off the waiver wire. In this sense, most players we start on a weekly basis have a positive points above replacement statistic. This implies that our aggregate team PAR score might be judging our teams relative to one we can create off the waiver wire.\n",
    "\n",
    "This then suggests that the average rostered player would give us a better sense of the amount a team is helped by an individual **relative** to other teams. Teams are generally not starting replacement players on a weekly basis, so does it really make sense to peg point production to players that are not started? Because of this fact, I came to the solution of binning players into tiers and comparing their point production to these tiers. In our league, we start 1 QB, 2 RBs, 2 WRs, 1 TE, and 2 FLEX players (as well as 1 team defense and 1 kicker) and have 10 total teams. If we can calculate what a player in a given starting spot is expected to score, we could analyze how many points they contribute relative to a starting lineup consisting solely of bang average players. Let's drill down into running backs as a concrete example of this methodology. If in our league the top 10 running backs in a week scored 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, and 11 points respectively, we might say that the expected point return of eachs team's top running back (their RB1) was 14.5 points. In this respect, we could infer that a replacement (or perhaps more specifically an average) RB1 would be worth 14.5 points to their team. Thus the top scoring RB would have added 5.5 points to their team. We will call this value the Points Added Over Average (PAA)\n",
    "\n",
    "We could even go further and note that a player likely has a replacement for a given player sitting on their bench. In this sense, a players' value to a given team is actually a function of the bench strength for this team. Whereas the previous two measures are trying to analyze a player relative to the waiver wire and other teams respectively, this calculation would analyze a players' value relative to a teams' own players. If a team has good RBs or a strong backup quarterback, a given starter may not make as big of a difference to the team compared to if they were rostered by another user. Because of this team based approach, we will call this measure Points Added Over Substitution (PAS).\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe all these statistics have uses. We saw just this week that Derrick Henry was hurt and Noah was forced to replace him off the waiver wire. We may expect his points to drop by the value of Derrick Henry's PAR score. We all know that Stephane has had a brutal start to his season. In his case, it may be more interesting to compare how the running backs he drafted are performing relative to the top RB options on other squads. For this case we can analyze the PAA stat of his starting RBs to infer the amount they have hurt his season compared to other positional players. For PAS, Nahome has an extremely strong roster of WRs, so the marginal value of his starting WRs to the point total that his team scores is lower than if those WRs were placed on a team lacking at the position. I'll do my best to provide an overview of these analyses for each team, and then provide a league wide overview of team/position strength.\n",

    "The presence of bye weeks presents a slight difficulty in these calculations. I am making the conscious decision to ignore bye weeks even though some players have not yet had them while others have (and thus have had an extra week of production). My logic is for injured players, I would not want to remove weeks for when they are injured from this calculation since they would have scored 0 points if you had started them. Since each player will have a bye week at some point this season, I think the logic for leaving bye week production as 0 points is even more sound than for including injury weeks in the calculation. Essentially the argument boils down to this: If you are relying on a player to be your RB1 and they score 0 points on their bye week, other teams are still starting players who are RB1s. I believe this difference in points scored should therefore still count towards a players' production output."

    "## Generating Player PAR Estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating PAR estimates will generally be simpler than PAA estimates. I will just use the average points scored by players on the waiver wire (who have scored a non-zero amount of points, under the assumption that this is the true pool of replacement players) to generate an estimate of the average score for a replacement player at a given position. I will then compare this to the actual points scored by players on active rosters to generate the difference in points scored by a given player vs. this replacement pool. This stat can then be aggregated for a given team or for a position subgroup on a team to calculate the team and positional strength of a team relative to a team made up solely of replacement level players."
